<!-- //Dom is the document object model. It is used to represent the structure of a document as a tree of objects.
//With the help of dom we can manipulate the html using javascript.
//In simple words dom is an interface which helps us to interact with html using javascript.
//The dom represents the document as nodes and objects. That way programming languages can connect to the page.
//For example we can use dom to change the text of a paragraph, change the color of a div, add or remove elements from
the page and so on. -->
