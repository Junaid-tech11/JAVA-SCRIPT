🗓️ Day 1: The Interactive Modal (Prep)
The Goal: A button that opens a box. A generic "X" button that closes it.

Step 1: The HTML (The Skeleton)
You need 3 main elements in your index.html:

The Trigger: A simple <button> with an ID (e.g., open-btn) and text like "Show Offer".

The Overlay (Background): A <div> that covers the whole screen. Give it an ID (e.g., modal-overlay).

Tip: Inside this div, put your actual "White Box" content (Heading, Text, and a "Close" button with an ID like close-btn).

Link your files: Make sure to add <script src="script.js"></script> at the bottom of the body.

Step 2: The CSS (The Look)
In your style.css (or using Tailwind classes):

Hide the Modal: The modal should be invisible by default. Create a class called .hidden with display: none; (or use Tailwind's hidden).

Style the Overlay: The overlay needs to be fixed, inset-0 (top/left/right/bottom 0), and have a semi-transparent background (e.g., bg-black with opacity).

Center the Box: Use Flexbox on the Overlay (flex, justify-center, items-center) to put the white box dead center.

Step 3: The JavaScript (The Brains)
Open script.js. Do not copy code! Write this logic line-by-line:

Select Elements: Create 3 variables (modal, openBtn, closeBtn) using document.getElementById or querySelector to grab your HTML elements.

The "Open" Function:

Add an event listener to openBtn for a 'click'.

Inside the function, remove the .hidden class from your modal.

The "Close" Function:

Add an event listener to closeBtn for a 'click'.

Inside the function, add the .hidden class back to your modal.

Bonus (Click Outside):

Add an event listener to the window.

Check if (e.target === modal). If yes, hide the modal.
